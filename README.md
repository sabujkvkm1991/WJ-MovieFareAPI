üìò Overview
This project is a Movie Price Comparison Web Application that allows users to view and compare movie prices from two different providers. The core objective is to identify and display the cheapest price for a selected movie.

The application is built with resilience and fault-tolerance in mind, ensuring a seamless user experience even if one or both providers are partially or fully unavailable. This robustness allows the app to degrade gracefully without breaking functionality.
